# 🚀 Emil William | Software Engineer & Creative Craftsperson

A high-performance portfolio showcasing the intersection of **Systems Engineering (Rust)** and **Modern Web Architecture (React)**. This project is a testament to my philosophy: *Software is a craft, and the developer is an architect of experiences.*

## ✨ Key Features

- **High-Performance Navigation:** A custom-built mobile-responsive Navbar with active state tracking and smooth anchor link transitions.
- **Dynamic Project Gallery:** A scalable "Work" section that maps data from a centralized schema, allowing for rapid project updates without modifying core components.
- **Interactive Case Study Modals:** - **Accessibility First:** Integrated `Escape` key listeners and backdrop-click handlers.
    - **UX Polish:** Automated body-scroll locking to ensure a focused user experience when viewing project details.
- **Viewport-Aware Animations:** Advanced scroll-reveal effects using a reusable `framer-motion` wrapper, optimizing performance by only triggering animations as elements enter the viewport.
- **Cross-Platform Exploration:** Demonstration of **Tauri** integration for high-performance desktop application development using **Rust**.

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy: Craft & Velocity

I believe in **AI-augmented development** to achieve production-ready results at high velocity without sacrificing technical rigor.
- **The Craft:** Every component, from modal state transitions to viewport-aware animations, is built for maintainability, type safety, and accessibility.
- **The Velocity:** Leveraging advanced AI workflows (Claude/Gemini) to move from concept to deployment in record time, focusing on solving complex architectural logic rather than repetitive syntax.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Hybrid Architecture (Web + Systems)
- **Cinera App:** Explores the high-performance world of **Tauri and Rust**, bringing a sleek React frontend to a native desktop environment.
- **Spotify Dashboard:** Implements complex data visualization and third-party API orchestration with the Spotify Web API.
- **Expense Splitter Pro:** A PWA focusing on robust state management and real-time UI updates for group financial tracking.

### 2. UI/UX Architecture
- **Reusable Animation Wrappers:** Built a custom `<AnimatedContent />` component leveraging `framer-motion` to handle `whileInView` logic globally.
- **Clean Component Logic:** Strict separation of concerns between data (`projects.js`), styling (Modular CSS), and presentation logic.
